## Realtime News Backoffice
The Realtime Code Hosting service provides you an easy way of executing server-side scripts without the need of managing the required infrastructure. You write the code and Realtime takes care of all the backend heavy-lifting issues.

To illustrate the main concepts we've built an enterprise mobile app. This repository contains the CMS backoffice where you're able to manage the app's contents.
